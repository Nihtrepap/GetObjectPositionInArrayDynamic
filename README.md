# DynamicGetPositionInArray
 I needed to get index of an object inside an array. 
 The object had several properties to check.
 The tricky part were to find one function that works on older IE. 
 So had to make this, at least I thought I did.
 But in the end this function were not needed at all. 
 Figured it might come to use one day, or not... :P
